"""To-Do's"""
# • Todo: Try gradient clipping (norm?, value?)
# • Todo: Implement retrace without division
# • Todo: Try different weight initialization


"""Notes and warnings"""
# • when using trjectories with different lengths be careful when reversing the trajectory for computing the
#   retrace loss because the trailing zeros should NOT be reversed!
